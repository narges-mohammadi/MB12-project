**Brief overview of study sites:**

The two experimental sites (MFC2 and GOR1) are located in the Upper Alento River Catchment (UARC) in Campania (southern Italy):

* MFC2 representative of the cropland zone of UARC with a co-existence of relatively sparse horticultural crops, olive, walnut, and cherry trees, 
    located near the village of Monteforte Cilento, on the south-facing hillslope of UARC.  

* GOR1 is representative of the woodland zone of UARC on the north-facing hillslope of UARC, located near the village of Gorga.
